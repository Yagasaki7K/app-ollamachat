# Run GPT-OSS Locally with Thinking UI ðŸ§ 

Experience the power of GPT-OSS reasoning locally - see exactly how the model thinks through problems before giving you answers.

## Why This Matters

- **100% Local**: Run GPT-OSS on your own hardware using Ollama
- **See The Thinking**: Watch the model's reasoning process unfold in expandable panels
- **Privacy First**: Your conversations never leave your machine
- **GPT-OSS:20B**: Advanced reasoning capabilities with native thinking support
- **Zero Cost**: No API fees or usage limits

## Key Features

- **Thinking UI**: Expandable panels show model's reasoning process
- **Real-time Streaming**: See responses generate as the model thinks
- **Chat History**: Full conversation history with thinking processes preserved
- **Clean Interface**: Professional UI with OpenAI and Ollama logos
